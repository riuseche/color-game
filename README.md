# The Color Game

TCG is a guessing game to test your RGB skills. The game will initiate showing *6 squares* and a hit on the top, showing the current color you must find. 

## Red, Green, Blue color model
 
 RGB stands for "Red, Green, Blue" and is usually written as "rgb(r, g, b)" where rgb are valued from 0 to 255. In this model, a 0 means no color and a 255 refers to the max amount of color present. 

### Colors
 <li>rgb(255, 0, 0): Represents all red, no green, no blue.</li>
 <li>rgb(0, 255, 0): Represents no red, all green, no blue</li>
 <li>rgb(0, 0, 255): Represents no red, no green, all blue</li>
 <br>
 
Any other color is simply a combination of these values.

 
### Black and White

<li>rgb(0, 0, 0): This is black, all absence of color.</li>
<li>rgb(255, 255, 255): This is white, total presence of color.</li>

## Difficulty 

There's a couple of buttons that control the game's difficulty level. Play with them and watch the squares disappear to adjust to the difficulty.
